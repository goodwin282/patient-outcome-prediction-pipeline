End-to-end data pipeline for healthcare patient outcome prediction using Big Data techniques and technologies.

# Patient Outcome Prediction Pipeline

An end-to-end data pipeline for processing healthcare data and predicting patient outcomes. This project demonstrates advanced data engineering techniques while maintaining healthcare data compliance.

## Project Overview

This pipeline ingests Electronic Health Records (EHR) data, processes it securely, and enables predictive analytics for patient outcomes. It addresses the unique challenges of healthcare data including HIPAA compliance, data quality, and complex relationships between clinical variables.

## Technical Architecture

- Processing Framework: Databricks/PySpark
- Cloud Platform: AWS (or GCP alternative)
- Storage: S3 for data lake, Redshift for data warehouse
- Orchestration: Airflow
- Containerization: Docker, Kubernetes
- CI/CD: GitHub Actions
- Infrastructure as Code: Terraform
- Monitoring: Prometheus, Grafana

## Getting Started

(Instructions will be added as development progresses)
